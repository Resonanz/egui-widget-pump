Create a simple egui widget.

The widget should be contained in a fixed-size egui frame.

The frame should have a border and should change color slightly if the mouse pointer hovers over the frame.

Inside the frame there should be two squares that behave like on/off buttons.

The squares therefore need to store state.

The button state can be changed by either the mouse acting upon the widget, or by code outside the widget changing the button state.

While the mouse pointer is hovering over a square, it should change color.

If a square is clicked upon by the mouse, the state should toggle.
